# shopping-cart

## Setup
Create a new repository called "shopping-cart" using the GitHub online interface. Add a "README.md" file and a Python-flavored ".gitignore" file. 

After creating the remote repo, use GitHub Desktop software or the command-line to download or "clone" it onto your computer. Choose a familiar download location like Documents.

After cloning the repo, navigate there from the command-line:

```sh
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/rock-paper-scissors-exercise
```

Use your text editor or the command-line to create a file in that repo called "shopping_cart.py", and then place the following contents inside:

## Environment Setup

It is possible to complete this project using the "base" Anaconda environment, because the basic requirements don't require any third-party packages. However if you eventually end up tackling bonus challenges that require third-party packages, then you'll want to create and activate a new Anaconda virtual environment, and use a "requirements.txt" file approach to installing your packages:

```
# IF USING THIRD-PARTY PACKAGES, USE A NEW ENV:
conda create -n shopping-env python=3.8 
conda activate shopping-env
pip install -r requirements.txt # (after specifying desired packages inside)
```

Within an active virtual environment of choice ("base" or project-specific), demonstrate your ability to run the Python script from the command-line:

```py
python shopping_cart.py
```

If you see the provided "products" data structure, you're ready to move on to project development.

## Data Setup

The provided code includes a variable called products which facilitates management of the products inventory from within the application's source code. 

## Capturing User Inputs 

Steps:

1. Accept a user input value, store it in a variable, and print it. HINT: use the input() function ðŸ˜º.
2. One at a time, iteratively accept a user input value, store it in a variable, and print it. HINT: use an infinite while loop. NOTE: you may have to press "control-c" to quit your script if you get stuck.
3. One at a time, iteratively accept a user input value, store it in a variable, and print it. But stop the loop if the user inputs the word "DONE". HINT: use an if statement in conjunction with the break keyword.
4. Repeat the previous step, but instead of printing each user input, store them all in a single list. Then print the list after the user is "DONE".
